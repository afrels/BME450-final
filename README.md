## Project decription
This project's overall goal is to categorize any input movie review as having either positive or negative sentiment. This primary goal will be achieved using training from a dataset of 50,000 IMDb movies found via Kaggle available at the link below:

A secondary goal that will be attempted given enough success and time will be to re-train the network, or add another arm of the network, to guess a rating out of 10. The training data for this side goal can be seen below. The limitation of this goal will be from the dataset, as it only stretches from 7 to 10. A better set may need to be found.
